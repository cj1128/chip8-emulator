## Spec

- All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first.
- 4K RAM (`0x0 ~ 0xfff`)
  - `0x0 ~ 0x1ff`: reserverd for system
  - `0x200 ~ 0xe9f`: freely used RAM
  - `0xea0 ~ 0xeff`: reserved for stack, internal use and other variables
  - `0xf00 ~ 0xfff`: for display
- 64x32 resolution display (1 bit per pixel)
- Font sprite starts at `0x000`, see details below
- 8-bit delay and sound timer
- 16 8-bit registers `V0` ~ `VF`
- A 16-bit program counter (`PC`)
- A 8-bit stack pointer (`SP`)
- One 16-bit address register `I`
- [Instruction set](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Instruction-Set)
  - `8XYE`: `VF` should be the most significant bit of `VX` not `VY` prior to the shift
  - `8XY6`: Same as above
  - `FX55`: Don't increset `I`
  - `FX65`: Same as above

## Keymapping

```text
1 2 3 C        1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D   ->   Q W E R
7 8 9 E        A S D F
A 0 B F        Z X C V
```

## Build

This emulator uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) to do the rendering, so you need to install SDL2 first.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cj1128/chip8-emulator
$ cd chip8-emulator
$ make build
$ make run
```

## Test

There are a few roms in the `rom` directory of repo.

`BC_Test.ch8` and `test_opcode.ch8` are used for testing the fundamental functions of our emulator.

`test.ch8` is used for testing arbitrary instructions written by ourself.

All others are games for fully testing our emulator ðŸŽ®.
